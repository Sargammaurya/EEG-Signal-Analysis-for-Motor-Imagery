Performed motor imagery classification for four classes using various deep learning approaches, leveraging CNN-based architectures such as EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and ShallowConvNet. To address the issue of limited data, implemented data augmentation techniques including segment swapping and running window methods. Developed a hierarchical model that first classified samples into two groups, followed by separate binary models for finer classification. Additionally, converted EEG signals into spectrograms to facilitate transfer learning with pre-trained models like Inception-V3 and ResNet50, enhancing the overall performance and robustness of the classification process.
